I'm currently working on a mosquito-killing drone that uses sonar to locate mosquitoes, then zips over and grinds them in its propellers. The goal is to make entire cities mosquito-free cheaply. We've just demonstrated we could detect mosquitoes with ultrasonic sonar, and are now working on sensor miniaturization and drone integration.

In some ways, X1Plus is a very standard custom firmware: it jumps into a custom kernel, launches a patched userspace, and provides a handful of interesting features to users. And in some ways, X1Plus takes a relatively well-trodden path of exploiting relatively usual cheap IoT device security vulnerabilities that have been passed around from hand to hand for a while.

X1Plus is different in a few other interesting ways, though. For one, we decided that we wanted to ultimately open the project to public contribution, which meant that we would need to be very careful to avoid redistributing the OEM's IP as part of the build.
